This is a repository for a course in SYSU which aims to help the student to improve their ability to read and write scientific paper.

#### What's in it

* Implementation of DCGAN from [Yihui](https://github.com/yihui-he/GAN-MNIST)
* A png image to MNIST data format transform code from [gskielian](https://github.com/gskielian/JPG-PNG-to-MNIST-NN-Format), and thanks to [Austin FitzGerald](https://github.com/A-Fitz) for [fixing the jpg processing](https://github.com/A-Fitz/JPG-PNG-to-MNIST-NN-Format/commit/3368f96481963676f7a93d65791778375ec7d45d#diff-ac36eb2e490ead46f08c77c285caa165).
* A knn classification for MNIST from [anujdutt9](https://github.com/anujdutt9/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning)
* Latex source files of my writing homework

I'm very sorry that currently I don't have time to reorganize the files and write a concrete documentation for the repo.
